A repository filled with Codewars challenges (kata). Push 5 solutions every week.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=9751F7&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

I start or finish every day by doing a Codewars Challenge!

## Optimizations

I optimize my code with time and knowledge for maximum efficiency and readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

I've learned that problems with many solutions require being okay with not always having the best answer. Ego aside, I'm a lifelong learner with a never-ending tunnel of solutions heading straight for me. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
